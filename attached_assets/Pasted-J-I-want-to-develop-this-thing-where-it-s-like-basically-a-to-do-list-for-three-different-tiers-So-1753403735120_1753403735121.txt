I want to develop this thing where it’s like basically a to do list for three different tiers.

So the user will select one of the tears and there’s three of them based on what the client wants so like if the client picks one, it should give the user A to do list of all the items on tier one.
If the user selects tier 2, it will give the user a to do list of all the items on tier 2, the same for three.

The object of this, so the employee can keep track of all of the items they’re supposed to do within that tier for the client.

Scheduling 

Now that the user has selected the correct tier, they will need to repeat this process every month .

It needs to help schedule it for each month .

It needs to accurately display the items to be done in succession that will repeat each month. They will need to schedule it automatically spreading out the tasks over that month onto the correct days.



Well, then, output a calendar  to download.

The standard format for downloading a calendar compatible with Apple Calendar and Google Calendar is iCalendar (.ics)

Included in all of these at the end of every month will be a scheduled reminder to send the client a copy of the things that have been completed .

It needs to have a day for users to set the initial date to start off in the beginning .

Once the start date is selected, all dates after that need to update.
